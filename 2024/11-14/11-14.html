	<p>Subject: A Review and Ranking for Salads</p>
  <p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15p;">
  Far beyond the old times in primary school, when I was young, the question the teachers often ask me - next to the corny cliched "WhAt dO YoU WaNT tO bE in tHe FuTure?" conandrum - is what is your favorite food. That was and still is such a boring question. And as such a pretentious child as I am still now, rather than answerly truthfully McDonald's ice-cream. Full of affectedness, I said a salad. Such a bland question answered with such a bland food for eating and for thought.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
  What is more horrible than the question, and albeit, the answer I had said to my teachers for that question, is that karma catches up with you. Now with a bigger brain power than my 9 years-old self, I realised that salads are quite healthy. They aid digestion, the microbial health of guts, high in fibre - which again is good for your intestine and ofcourse your caca-poopoo - and yada yada yada. These healthiness does not a single bit break nor disagree with one fact. The fact that salads are sad godless bowl of bland vegetables often put together with wretchedly and more likely than not eaten by a menopausal woman in anguish caused mostly by the salad and accountedby some for her husband cheating with another woman who is more athletically inclined. But we, today, must not be that sad soon-to-be divorced wife.  
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
  Eating the salad is simply a fact that we must endure. And thus here written is what salad I prefered from most to least as that I could think of. The ranking system would be of the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ranking is of 3 stars with 3 stars being the most and 1 beign the least.</li>
  <li>(***) It is good. At this price I cannot complain. I would recommend others if they ask for these type of course of products or service. If I have the change I would repurchace when in need.</li>
  <li>(**) It is fine. I could complain, but the benefits do outweights the cons of the products. I would not recommend the products or service to others first in mind. I would not buy it again if I don't have to or there are any better products or service availible.</li>
  <li>(*) It is bad. Complain like a German I must. It is not worth the money. The negative outweights the benefit of the product or service. I would highly avoid the product or service if possible. No recommendations in the good lights would be made.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
   <b>Donki-Donki's Salmon Salad.</b><br>
   (***)<br>
   Price: 169 THB without plastic bags, 1 thb extra for plastic bag | ~130 THB near the department store's closing <br>
   Included: Salad with multiple pices of smoked salmon. Small tub of salad sauce. Chopsticks.<br>
   Description: I ahve eaten this thing twice. They are nothing but heavenly. I did tasted them from two locations in different stores on different date recently, one at the MBK Donki 2nd foor and another at Seacon Bangkhae. They tasted quite similarly the same so I would say that their quality control is quite good.<br>
   Although this smoked salmon sald is on the more expensive, the salmon is esquisitte. I do however, recommend snatching it after the price deduction around 20-30 percent off. The sauce does taste like ranch, however. All and all, this is a thing that I would eat on a weekend, for special occasion.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
   <b>Royal-Project's Ready to Eat Salad with Tomato Sauce</b><br>
   (***)<br>
   Price: 55 THB<br>
   Included: Unfathomably large amount of greens. A slice of bell pepper. 3 small cherry tomatoes. 2 slices of cucumber. Some onions.<br>
   Description: I picked this up from the Royal-Project's shop near the shopping mall close to my school simply beacuse of convinince of the store's location of proximity. Initially, from the looking of the sauce, my expectation was that it would be something of resemblelence to Mexican or Spanish food. That was not true. It is not bad persay but it is not Mexican. It is not theirs to blame, but I did not read the packaging. <br>
   This was, however, a lucky little accident as I was hooked to its taste. The sauce cuts very well, providing a very juicy and fruitly mouthfeel to otherwise a very bland assortments of greens yet crunchy and fresh. The small tomatoes are sweet but not so much that it would out do the main theme of the suace but enough to make a tiny small note which harmonises very well althogether. Despite that, the cucumbers has a slight metalic tang which quite very well depreciates the overall experince abit. I would recommeend you to leave them to the side but please do enjoy the rest of them.<br>
   For the price of 55 THB though, there is not much to complain. The salad bowl provides the fullness of a similar couse meal that could be purchased in a metropolitian area which could be more expensive and take more of its toll on one's health.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
   There are more that I would like to write a review about later. But as of today, enough had I procrasited from my actual work. I will continue this article on later and thus the latter letters will be attached to this current letter later on. Toodle-oo.
