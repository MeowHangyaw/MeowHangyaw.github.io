	<p>Subject: Invitation to join Meow Hangyaw's Speakeasy</p>
	<p> Dear Esteemed Readers,</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">&#9;
It is with great excitement that I introduce you to <b>Meow Hangyaw's Speakeasy</b>, a new blog dedicated to whatever I curate. Just call it "speakeasy" or whatnot, who cares. Frankly, I think the first name is too long, but it will do.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">&#9;
If you are not fond of my name, I must applaud you for finding this absolute backstreet of the internet without viewing the CV website first.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">&#9;
The blog will be formatted into memos and letters, mostly the latter. This is due to my pursuit of sending letters as a hobby. One need not ask if it goes well or not when one changes the hobby to writing a blog.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">&#9;
Obviously, since the blog will be formatted as a letter‚Äîmore specifically, the Thai style‚Äîthe international business style I refuse to adopt. The time and date will not reflect when it is posted but when I finish writing. Hence, a letter. You see there? I am using this little letter gimmick to my advantage. Huzzah for me! Formatting one's writing from the Notes app to HTML on an iPad or, God forbid, a phone, is a living nightmare. But one must persevere.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">&#9;
As I decided to be economical and efficient with my time, I concluded that the default font would suffice as a reading tool, since I hardly want to maintain the coding scheme. I did consider creating a fancy commenting system or a more sophisticated version of something similar; however, I shan‚Äôt, for the same reasons as above. The search system is designed to cater to you. Just use the Ctrl-F search function on your browser. For Mac, I hypothesise that it would be Cmd-F.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">&#9;
I must warn you not to expect this blog to be as regular as one might hope for one's bowel movements. I have other things to do, but I will try to write... occasionally. Also, you are free to email me about any spelling mistakes I make, including grammatical errors. Honestly, I am glad you have that much free time to do so.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">&#9;
I courteously invite you to join me on this journey, and I look forward to your insights and feedback, which you can send via email.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">&#9;
I hope for your support, and please stay tuned for more. Thank you.
</p>
